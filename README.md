# Peer Assessment Application - we_cant_think_of_a_name_SOEN341-Project_F24

## Project Overview
This project is a **Peer Assessment System** designed for university team projects, allowing students to evaluate their teammates' contributions across four key dimensions: Cooperation, Conceptual Contribution, Practical Contribution, and Work Ethic. It promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback to both students and instructors on team dynamics and individual efforts. 

The development process follows the Agile Scrum methodology, with four sprints over a 10-week period. This system will feature **student assessments**, **anonymous peer feedback**, and an **instructor dashboard** for team management and evaluation.

## Features
- **Student Assessment**: Students evaluate their teammates based on cooperation, conceptual and practical contributions, and work ethic.
- **Anonymous Peer Feedback**: Peer feedback is anonymized to encourage honest, constructive feedback.
- **Instructor Dashboard**: Instructors can manage teams, view assessment results, and export data in CSV format.

## Sprint Planning
- **Sprint 1**: Initial setup of User Authentication & Team Management. The key focus is on implementing:
  - Student and Instructor login system (with roles).
  - Functionality for instructors to create teams and assign students.

## GitHub Workflow
Our project will be managed through GitHub using Issues for user stories and tasks. Each issue will be labeled with:
- `US.#` for user stories.
- `Task.#` for specific tasks broken down from the user stories.

## Contribution Tracking
All team members will log their contributions and time spent on tasks. These logs will be submitted at the end of each sprint for evaluation.

## Meeting Minutes
We will hold regular team meetings to discuss progress, address any blockers, and update our sprint plan. Meeting minutes will be stored in the corresponding `Sprint#_meetingnumber_meetingdate.md` files in the repository.
